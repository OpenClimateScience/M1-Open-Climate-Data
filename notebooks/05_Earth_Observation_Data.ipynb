    "NASA's constellation of earth-observing satellites offers many sources of information on earth's climate system. NASA's [Eyes on the Earth website](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/earth/) shows where many of these satellites are in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of NASA's earth-observing satellites have **sun-synchronous, polar orbits** (see figure below). This means that the satellite's orbit always passes (nearly) over the earth's poles as the earth spins beneath it. When the satellite is moving between the poles, it crosses the equator at the same local time, over a different part of the earth.\n",

    "Earth-observing satellites carry sensors pointed at the earth for taking measurements of the earth's surface or atmosphere. The sensors measure some part of the electromagnetic spectrum: either visible light, near-infrared and short-wave infrared light, infrared waves, or microwaves. These sensors can be described in terms of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spectral resolution:** How many types of electromagnetic energy are detected and how narrow the spacing between wavelength bands is.\n",
    "- **Spatial resolution:** The smallest target size that can be measured on the ground.\n",
    "- **Temporal resolution:** How often a sensor acquires data on a specific location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The temporal resolution is also referred to as the **revisit time:** how long it takes for the sensor to view the same location on the earth from the same viewing angle. The revisit time determines how often we can get information on agricultural systems."
