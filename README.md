M1: Open Climate Data
=====================

> How are NASA satellites, field data, and models used to diagnose and predict Earthâ€™s climate system? How is climate variability measured and modeled?

The first module of our [open climate-science curriculum](https://openclimatescience.github.io/curriculum) focuses on familiarizing learners with NASA Earthdata Search and with the variety of climate datasets NASA offers. **At the end of this module, you should be able to:**

- Understand how climate data from reanalysis datasets, General Circulation Models, and Earth System Models are generated and how these models differ.
- Know where different climate variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature) can be obtained at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales.
- Demonstrate the use of multiple climate variables from different climate datasets.


Getting Started
---------------

You can run the notebooks in this repository using [Github Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) or as [a VSCode Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). Once your container is running, launch Jupyter Notebook by:

```sh
# Create your own password when prompted
jupyter server password

# Then, launch Jupyter Notebook; enter your password when prompted
jupyter notebook
```
